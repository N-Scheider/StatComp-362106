# Exercise

Consider a subset of mcycle data (of the MASS package) for times $â‰¤ 40$ and use cross-validation to select

* the polynomial degree of p from candidate values $p = 1, 2, 3$, and 
* the bandwidth $h$ from candidate values $h = 3, 4, . . . , 15$

for a local polynomial smoother as implemented by the `locpol()` function from the package of the same name.

Notes:

* Compare your results with what you would expect based on Manual 10 in order to avoid wrong conclusions.
  * even better: use your own visualizations to verify your progress
* You may run into issues for large p and small h if you use small number of folds.
* Beware of how your points are ordered.

```{r fig.cap=c("Figure that plots the different degrees p of a local polynomial regression against different bandwidths (from 3:15)", "plots the local polynomial regression with the bandwidth and the degree with the smallest MSE"),  fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}

mcycle <- mcycle[mcycle$times <= 40, ]
p_degree <- c(1, 2, 3)
hgrid <- 3:15

# data frame to capture different errors

colnames(df_err) <- c("Degree 1", "Degree 2", "Degree 3")
rownames(df_err) <- c(hgrid)

# length of data set
