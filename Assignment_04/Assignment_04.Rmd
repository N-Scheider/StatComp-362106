# Exercise

Consider a subset of mcycle data (of the MASS package) for times â‰¤ 40 and use cross-validation to select
the polynomial degree of p from candidate values p = 1, 2, 3, and the bandwidth h from candidate values h = 3, 4, . . . , 15
for a local polynomial smoother as implemented by the locpol() function from the package of the same name.
Notes:
Compare your results with what you would expect based on Manual 10 in order to avoid wrong conclusions.
even better: use your own visualizations to verify your progress You may run into issues for large p and small h if you use small number of folds.
Beware of how your points are ordered.
